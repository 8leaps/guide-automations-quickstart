## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed

## Get started now

### 1. X.com Developer App Settings

Before you are able to post on X, you will need to create an X app so that you can connect to the X API later on.

### Step 1: Create X Developer Account

1. Go to [developer.x.com](https://developer.x.com)
2. Sign up for a developer account
3. Create a new app

### Step 2: Configure App Settings

**User authentication settings:**

- **App permissions**: Read and write
- **Type of App**: Web App, Automated App or Bot (Confidential client)

**App info:**

- **Callback URL**: `http://localhost:5000/integrations/social/x`

2. Copy your **API Key** and **API Secret**
3. Generate **Access Token** and **Access Token Secret**
4. Copy your **Bearer Token**

### 2. Container Setup

### Step 1: Configure Environment Variables

Before starting the services, you need to create a `.env` file with your configuration:

1. Copy the environment template:

   **Windows:**

   ```cmd
   copy env.template .env
   ```

   **macOS/Linux:**

   ```bash
   cp env.template .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file and fill in your values:
   - **Required**: Update the X API credentials (X_API_KEY, X_API_SECRET, X_ACCESS_TOKEN, X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET, X_BEARER_TOKEN)
   - **Required**: Set a secure JWT_SECRET (generate a random string)
   - **Optional**: Configure other social media APIs if needed
   - **Optional**: Set up Cloudflare R2 for file storage (or leave as-is for local storage)

### Step 2: Start Both Services

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start both Postiz and n8n services.

2. The X API credentials should already be configured from your `.env` file
3. **Test the connection** - it should show "Connected" or similar
4. You should now see your X account in the integrations list

3. "Customize n8n to you": Get started (in other words skip)
4. "Get paid features for free (forever)": Skip (left bottom button)

### Step 2: Install Postiz Node
